# Star Wars Intro
The opening crawls from all Star Wars episodes.  
Available at [jlozovei.github.io/star-wars-intro](https://jlozovei.github.io/star-wars-intro).


## :gem: Stack
Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) - to create reusable components and the routing layer (with [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)). All the transitions were built with plain, old CSS (keyframes and delays).

I've copied the crawls from [Star Wars Fandom](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Opening_crawl).
